This is a placeholder for the actual audio file. In a real implementation, you would place a valid MP3 file here. For testing purposes, you can:

1. Find a royalty-free 90s-style MIDI or MP3 file online
2. Convert it to MP3 format if needed
3. Place it in the public/audio/ directory
4. Or upload a MIDI file to your Cosmic CMS homepage object

The player will automatically use the MIDI file from Cosmic CMS if available, otherwise it will fall back to this placeholder file.
