## Prompts

This application was built using the following prompts to generate the content structure and code:

### Content Model Prompt

> "Build me a full single-page website that looks and feels like it was made in the 1990s. Use outdated design trends like pixelated fonts, bright neon colors, gradients, background textures, clip art, low-res images, scrolling marquees, flashing text, and lots of tables. Include fake visitor counters, 'Under Construction' gifs, and a guestbook link at the bottom. Add a cheesy animated logo, a MIDI music player (muted by default), and a 'Sign My Guestbook' button. Write all the copy in a fun, enthusiastic tone like a personal homepage from 1997. The topic of the site is my love of the 90s."
